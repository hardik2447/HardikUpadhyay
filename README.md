# Hi there!

I'm a Solution Architect and Techno Geek who is passionate about everything related to technology and business transformation ideas. <br>
In my free time, I run [a blog](https://blog.savetchuk.com/) where I write about interesting things that I learn along the way. <br>
When I need to unwind, I usually spend time with family and go for a walk.
